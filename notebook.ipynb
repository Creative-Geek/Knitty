      "**Guidelines:**\n",
      "- Extract single words or short phrases (2-3 words maximum)\n",
      "- Include both explicit skills mentioned and implied competencies\n",
      "- Normalize variations (e.g., \"JavaScript\" and \"JS\" should be \"JavaScript\")\n",
      "- Include both technical and soft skills\n",
      "- Avoid generic words like \"the\", \"and\", \"experience\" unless part of a specific term\n",
      "- Include industry-standard abbreviations and acronyms\n",
      "- Capture different forms of the same skill (e.g., \"manage\", \"management\", \"manager\")\n",
