      "1. Extract keywords that are professionally relevant and valuable for job matching, skill assessment, or career analysis\n",
      "2. Focus on the following categories:\n",
      "   - Technical skills (programming languages, software, tools, frameworks)\n",

      "   - Relevant technologies and methodologies\n",
      "   - Important action verbs that demonstrate capabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "**Guidelines:**\n",
      "- Extract single words or short phrases (2-3 words maximum)\n",
      "- Include both explicit skills mentioned and implied competencies\n",
      "- Normalize variations (e.g., \"JavaScript\" and \"JS\" should be \"JavaScript\")\n",
      "- Include both technical and soft skills\n",
      "- Avoid generic words like \"the\", \"and\", \"experience\" unless part of a specific term\n",
      "- Include industry-standard abbreviations and acronyms\n",
      "- Capture different forms of the same skill (e.g., \"manage\", \"management\", \"manager\")\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output Format:**\n",
      "Return your response as a JSON array of strings, where each string is a single keyword or short phrase.\n",
